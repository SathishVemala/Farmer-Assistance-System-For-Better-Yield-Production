● The main motive of this project is to consume less amount of water and better yielding of crops. 

● With the help of this project farmers gain some knowledge on technology.

● I have gained some knowledge in introduction to IoT from Cisco. And got course completion certificate for completing Cisco Networking Academy® Introduction to
IoT course. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

● After registration of the devices with the home gateway, to control the IoT 
devices remotely using a tablet. The registered IoT devices can be 
viewed on the tablet.

● The devices can be manually operated as well as the values can be 
viewed and monitored in real-time.

● It shows the status of the IoT devices registered with the home gateway. 
These devices can be manually as well as automatically monitored.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE:

● A smart irrigation system is implemented using the Cisco packet 
tracer. A home gateway to register the devices and control them using 
a tablet.

● All the IoT devices connected to the home gateway can be monitored 
manually as well as remotely by the user. The results prove that there 
is an opportunity of applying this model in real life. 

● It also makes it convenient for the user to access all the devices 
through the smartphone. In the field of IoT, ensuring security should be 
a priority. Since the IoT devices are interconnected to each other, the 
network should be secured.
