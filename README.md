● The main motive of this project is to consume less amount of water and better yielding of crops. 

● With the help of this project farmers gain some knowledge on technology.

● I have gained some knowledge in introduction to IoT from Cisco. And got course completion certificate for completing Cisco Networking Academy® Introduction to
IoT course. 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

● After registration of the devices with the home gateway, to control the IoT 
devices remotely using a tablet. The registered IoT devices can be 
viewed on the tablet.

● The devices can be manually operated as well as the values can be 
viewed and monitored in real-time.

● It shows the status of the IoT devices registered with the home gateway. 
These devices can be manually as well as automatically monitored.

● Goal: To create a smart irrigation system using Cisco packet tracer.

● Tools used: Cisco packet tracer simulation tool. 

● Outcome: This project helps the farmers for better yielding of crops.
